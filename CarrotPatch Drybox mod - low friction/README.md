# voron Carrot Patch IKEA Drybox Mod - less friction upgrade

Attention! This is an early beta project. <br>

A modification of the IKEA Drybox Mod (Carrot-Patch) <br>
I had some issues with friction. So I made these mayor changes.<br>

The new connector from the spool to the buffer is designed as a clip for an electricity interior wall tube </p>(search for: REV 0579217555 Iso-Tube, Cable Tube EN16 Flexible)<br>

I also use this orange tube from the drybox to the feeder. Therefore you find the stl: electroTube-Adapter-toPTFE.stl<br><hr>
The MainStand is more stable an has a bearing roll for the spool.
