# voron Carrot Patch IKEA Drybox Mod - less friction upgrade

Attention! This is an early beta project. <br>

A modification of the IKEA Drybox Mod (Carrot-Patch) <br>source: <a href="https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject/tree/main/usermods/IKEA_Drybox_Carrot_Patch">EtteGit/EnragedRabbiteProject/usermods/IKEA_Drybox_Carrot_Patch/</a><br>
I had some issues with friction. So I made these mayor changes.</p>
Reducing the friction:<br>
1. of te bowden from the drybox to the ERF <br>
2. at the 90Â° bend from the spool to the buffer <br>
3. of the spool by adding bearings <br>


The new connector from the spool to the buffer is designed as a clip for an electricity interior wall tube </p>(search for: REV 0579217555 Iso-Tube, Cable Tube EN16 Flexible)<br>

The MainStand is more stable an has a bearing roll for the spool.
