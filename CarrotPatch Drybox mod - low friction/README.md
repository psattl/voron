A modification of the IKEA Drybox Mod (Carrot-Patch) <br>
I had some issues with friction. So I made these mayor changes.<br>

The new connector from the spool to the buffer is designed as a clip for an electricity interior wall tube </p>(search for: REV 0579217555 Iso-Tube, Cable Tube EN16 Flexible)<br>

The MainStand is more stable an has a bearing roll for the spool.
